# **Wine Quality Prediction Analysis**

## **🌟 Overview**
This project focuses on predicting wine quality based on its chemical properties using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to classify wines as either Good or Bad, leveraging various feature selection methods and supervised learning algorithms. By analyzing and visualizing key characteristics, this project aims to extract valuable insights that can help winemakers improve their products.

## **❓ Why This Project?**
